/* This code in the CSS, and the code in the HTML section, is a trimmed down and modified version of Treasure Porth's example. 
 In the CSS, I originally "commented out" sections to check whether they were important for the HEADER or not, before deleting them.
 My interpretation of the instructions is that I am being asked to submit a HEADER portion of a web page, and that the details are to be located/positioned within the HEADER (Hero) image itself. My background image was 720px in height but I needed to include all of it to be able to really show the full location within which Sammi was discovered. I realise that perhaps this has made the total size of the image as it appears in the browser is rather outsized relative to a typical Hero image. If this was work being done for a client I would find another way to crop/resize the image but since this here is 'practice' only, I wanted to be able to show the entre image and with the correct proportions (not stretched or warped).

I learnt how to add the BUTTON from https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/html/how-to-create-an-html-button-that-acts-like-a-link.html
I learnt how to change the font size from https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_font_size.asp
I positioned the images by trial and error, modifying the existing code from Treasure Porth.
Header tags h1 & h3 have been used as instructed but I think the styling may be overridden by the CSS fixed font size within .tag that I entered of 30px ?
